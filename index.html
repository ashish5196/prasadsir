        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate web developer with
          expertise in front-end technologies. I have experience of 4+ years
          with 2 years in amazon with non-technical profile and another 2.5
          years in PIKTORLABS and UST Global. I worked on various projects which
          really made me proficient in working and handaling the work pressure. I also have done course for AWS from Great Learning which really made me very aware about cloud technologies.
